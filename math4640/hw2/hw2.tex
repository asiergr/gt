\section*{1}
Do three iterations of the bisection method by hand for $f(x) = x^3 - 2$
starting with the interval $a,b = [0,2]$. What is the interval at the end
of the third iteration? Show your work.

\textbf{Answer:}\\
Iteration 1:\\
We have that $a=0$ and $m = 1$, hence $\sign(f(0)) =\sign(f(1))$. So the interval
is now $[1,2]$

Iteration 2:\\
We have that $a = 1$, and $m = 1.5$. Thus, $\sign(f(1)) \neq sign(f(1.5))$. The
new interval is now $[1,1.5]$.

Iteration 3:\\
We have that $a=1$ and $m= 1.25$. Thus, $sign(f(1)) = sign(f(1.25))$. The new
interval is $[1.25,1.5]$.

After the third iteration we are left with the interval $a,b = [1.25,1.5]$.

\section*{2}
Write a program that does the bisection method for the following functions
until the approximation error (how far away you could be from the real root)
is less that Err. Tol = $10^{-6}$. Use the relationship discussed in class to
determina a priori how many iterations you expect ir to take for the method to
converge to this error tolerance. Plot the approximation error versus
iteration number for all cases on one log-log plot. What is the slope of the
line on the plot? What does the slope of the plot indicate?

\textbf{Answer:}\\
The following listing is in Python 3:
