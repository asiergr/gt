\section*{Question 1}
For each of the languages described below in prose, write a regular expression
that matches the language, or explain why no such regular expression exists.

\subsection*{a)}
All numerals in base 4 denoting unsigned integers in which successive digits do not
increase and there are no unnecessary leading zeros. [10 points]
For example, the following numerals are in the language: 3211, 310, 210,
22110, and 0. The following numerals are not in the language: 312, 122, 010, and 00.

\subsection*{b)}
A language of program identifiers for a conventional programming language over
the alphabet of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and the underscore.
An identifier must start with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore.
If an identifier starts with an underscore, that first symbol must be followed
with either a (lower or upper case) letter or a digit. [15 points]
For example, the following strings are in the language: a\_0, b10, and \_a\_0.
The following strings are not in the language: 2a, 4\_, and \_ \_a.

\section*{Question 2}
The following grammar G defines a simple programming language. Each program contains
a single function “main” consisting of a sequence of (integer) formal parameters
and a single statement, where the statement could be either an assignment or a return
statement. Non-terminal symbols start with lower-case English letters; terminal
symbols start with upper-case English letters or are punctuation symbols. Note
that only non-terminal symbols can occur on the left hand sides of productions.

\begin{lstlisting}
    (1) prog $\to$ MAIN(params){stmt}
    (2) params $\to \varepsilon$
    (3) params $\to$ VAR, params
    (4) stmt $\to$ VAR = expr;
    (5) stmt $\to$ RETURN expr;
    (6) expr $\to$ term
    (7) expr $\to$ term op term 
    (8) op $\to$ +
    (9) op $\to$ *
    (10) term $\to$ VAR
    (11) term $\to$ CONST
    (12) term $\to$ (expr)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{a)}
For each production in G, compute the FIRST set for its right hand side,
the FOLLOW set for its left hand side, and the FIRST+ set for the entire
production. Please only put terminal symbols or $\epsilon$ in those sets. [50 points]

\subsection*{b)}
Is grammar G an LL(1) grammar? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and
modify grammar G so as to obtain grammar G' that is LL(1) and derives
exactly the same language as grammar G. [20 points]

\subsection*{c)}
Generalize G to grammar G'' that describes programs in which the body of
main contains a sequence of one or more statements. Grammar G'' should 
be unambiguous. [5 points]
