\section{}
 (a) I am a 3rd year CS and mathematics double major.

(b) I am taking this class because it is a requirement, and also because I hope to
find the joy in algebra that I was not able to find in analysis (both real and complex).

I hope to learn more about the more abstract ideas of mathematics and how they
interact with the more "commonplace" math we are used to.

In order to succeed
I plan on developing habits of study and homework for this class so that I do
not have to cram or do things last minute.

(c) No concerns! I actually chose to take this class this semester because
you were my professor for MATH 2106, and I greatly enjoyed your teaching style in
that class :)

(d) I consent to possibly appearing in class recordings.
